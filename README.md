## XML SAX parser for UFED/Cellebrite.

The parser extracts some digital traces (Cyber items) from XML reports generated by UFED Physical Analyser (version 7.x) and convert them into CASE as JSON-LD files.

The UFED parser is able to process any report, regardless their size, it has been developed using **Python, version 3.x** and based on **SAX** (Simple API for XML).

The UFED parser is composed of three different modules:

* parser_UFEDtoCASE (main program)
* caseJson.py (class for generating CASE-JSON-LD files)
* parserDebug (class for producing text files for debugging purpose only)

## Requirements
The tool has been developed in Python version 3.x and here are some required modules:

* xml.sax (SAX classes)
* string (string utilities)
* argparse (args input management)
* os (operating system utilities)
* codecs (UTF-8 and other codec management)
* re (regular expressions management)
* uuid (global unique identifier management)

## Usage

```js
> *parser_UFEDtoCASE.py  [-h]*
>                       *-r INFILEXML*
>                       *-t kind_of_trace*
>                       *-o OUTPUT_CASE_JSON*
>                       *-d OUTPUT_DEBUG*
```
where:

```js
* -h, --help (show the help message and exit)
* -r | --report INFILEXML (the UFED XML report to be converted into CASE, compulsary)
* -t | --trace {all,call,contact,chat,sms,web_page,email} (Traces to be extracted, optional, default all)
* -o | --output OUTPUT_CASE_JSON (CASE-JSON-LD file to be generated, compulsory)
* -d | --debug OUTPUT_DEBUG (output file for debug)
```

## Mobile Forensic Data set
The UFED parser has been developed and tested relying on a huge collection of mobile forensic dataset. This is composed of images made available on the Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets  (CFReDS) Project.

## CASE representation: JSON-LD files
All the XML reports have been processed to generate the corresponding CASE representation of the following Cyber items:

* Call
* Chat (Whatsapp, Skype, etc.)
* Contact
* File
* Email
* SMS
* Web History
* Chain of Evidence
* Context
  * Device
  * Tool
  * Performer
  * Provenance Record
  * Investigative Acquisition
  * Investigative Extraction

Some simple examples are provided in the **json** folder, a report of an Android image is also available in the **XMLreports** folder.
